                <h5 class="text-center">Ph.D. – My background as a Meditation Teacher and Psychologist</h5>
                <p class="lead p-2 m-3">In the early 1970’s I left my home in Los Gatos California and traveled around the world
                    for two years, mostly overland, and started my meditation and yoga practice in a small
                    yoga ashram in Rishikesh India. After returning home I was initiated by Bhagavan
                    Nityananda and I traveled to Ganeshpuri India and became a student of Nityananda’s
                    disciple, Swami Muktananda. I stayed with Swami Muktananda for 12 years and was
                    often the temple drummer during chanting (kirtan) and was his personal driver for
                    several years. In the early 1990’s I practiced and trained with Gen Khandro in the
                    Tibetan Buddhist tradition for five years and was authorized to teach meditation and
                    trainings. Since 2000 I have been a student of Thich Nhat Hanh in the Zen tradition and
                    was ordained in the Order of Interbeing (OI) in 2012. My wife Sally and I have had a
                    meditation center in our home for the last 20 years and host monthly daylong practice
                    sessions for other OI members. As a child psychologist at Kaiser Permanente, I started
                    a family meditation program and also taught patients and staff meditation in the hospital
                    until my retirement from Kaiser three years ago. As a meditation teacher I honor and
                    incorporate teachings from many world traditions and especially the Zen Buddhist
                    tradition and the teachings of Ramana Maharshi and Sri Ramakrishna. I provide
                    consultation and trainings in mindfulness and meditation and teach weekly meditation
                    classes in several locations and also teach in the business and medical settings.</p>
                    <p class="lead p-2 m-3">I am profoundly aware of the power of spiritual practices such as yoga and meditation to transform negative mental states and to create a path of lifelong healing and healthy
                    self-actualization. The core teaching is, “We already have what we are looking for- it is
                    just covered up”. Spiritual practice lets the covering dissolve so our true light of being can shine out.</p>
                    <p class="lead p-4 m-3">In my personal life I am a father with two grown children.  I have travelled extensively and lived outside of the United States including five years living in India.  I can converse and read fairly well in Spanish and am studying so that I can teach meditation in
                    Spanish. I enjoy surfing, biking, riding my one-wheel pint, meditating, creating mosaics,and hiking with my wife Sally. Sally and I have been practicing meditation together for almost 50 years and she and I often co-facilitate meditation trainings and classes.</p>
