              <ol>
              <li>Step 1: We feel or visualize the suffering of our self or another being by visualizing the heavy negative energy, or illness, or painful life situation of our self or another being. </li>
              <li> Step 2: We develop the intention to take in that suffering to our own heart and transform it. We imagine that we are breathing in the suffering into our heart. </li>
              <li> Step 3: We visualize that the powerful energy that we are breathing in has the power to dissolve allof our fear and ego which releases the pure light of our being which has been covered up by our fear and ego.</li>
              <li> Step 4: with our out breath we imagine that we are giving all of our light and good karma to the person that is suffering and they receive the healing and find relief.</li>
